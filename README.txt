== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin measure carbon emissions? =

We use the Website Carbon Calculator API to measure and calculate the transfer size of the page. It then checks whether the site is running on renewable energy. Finally, it uses those two details to calculate the emissions. You can learn more about it at https://www.websitecarbon.com/how-does-it-work/.
